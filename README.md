# MS-Object-Detection-Interpretability
Applying Interpretability Algorithms to Multi-Source Object Detection

The goal of the project is to apply deep learning interpretability algorithms to models trained on multi-source inputs. An example of multi-source inputs would be satellite imagery with land-use maps added as an extra channel. The interpretability algorithms will be used to reveal how the model is utilizing the information from the different source inputs.

Satellite imagery is gathered from the xView dataset, and land-use maps are collected from OpenStreetMaps.
